          <p>
            At the Swahili Pot Hub Foundation (SPH), we are committed to making a
            positive impact on the lives of young individuals in Mombasa County and
            its six sub-counties. For the past seven years, we have been dedicated
            to helping youth overcome challenges and thrive. Through strategic
            partnerships with communities, government entities, CSOs, and local
            leaders, SPH has been a beacon of hope for young people from diverse
            backgrounds.

          <h2>The Case Management Project: A Path to Empowerment</h2>
          <p>
            The primary objective of the Case Management Project is to connect
            60,000 youth in Mombasa County and its sub-counties to a wide range of
            opportunities and sustainable employment. We understand that each young
            person is unique, and to empower them effectively, we emphasize a
            personalized case management approach. This approach allows us to offer
            customized support and guidance, helping young individuals access and
            thrive in various educational, vocational, and entrepreneurial pathways.
